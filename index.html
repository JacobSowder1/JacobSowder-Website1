        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello Everyone. My name is Jacob Sowder and I'm the founder of Surf Lessons Worldwide. I grew up in sunny Hunington Beach, California in what is known as surf city USA. I spent most of my time in the water growing up fasicinated by the ocean. All the of the simple life allowed me to escape from the harsh realities of the world for just a little while. I love to surf and inspire others to find the joy in it as well, just like I did, along with so many others. That is why I statrted this company in the first place, to bring that same joy I get from it every single day. I have had a small group of five friends that I spent most of my childhood days srufing and living with. We share the same ideals and aspirations to teach the youth what surfing is all about. Those five other guys are key intructors that are apart of Surf LEssons Worldwide. <br><br>

        I have one older brother, mother, and father who all share the love of surfing with me. My parents grew up surfing and introduced it to me at a young age. From that very young age of 2 years old I fell in love. Not only did I spend hours a day surfing I've also played a multitude of sports throughout my life and one i'm still playing. Some of the sports including baseball, soccer, and basketball. Not too long ago I attended a community college called Mount San Antonio Community College in Walnut California. There I was lucky enough to be a part of the Men's Soccer program. I spent two years playing soccer and attending school at Mount San Antonio Community College. After my two years at Mount San Antonio, I transfered to The University of Riverside. I currently attend The University of Riverside in Riverside California where I am majoring in Economic Administrative Studies. Also, I'm fortunate enough to be a part of the Men's Soccer Program at UCR. Unfortunately due to the COVID-19 pandemic I've been kept from meeting my future teammates. During this time, away from sports I've taken full advantage of my time and spent it surfing all hours of the day. During this time I was reflecting in the water when I came up with the idea to start my own surf lessons bbusinees. I thought to myself, if I could just make one persons life better every day then I'd consider myself sucessful. Everyday we get thousands of calls and emails requsting a lesson from Surf Lessons Worldwide. With the tight knit group of 5 guys I grew up with surfing we travel the world providng surf lessons to individual parties or big groups.   <br><br><br><br>

        I am grateful to every single person who supports Surf Lessons Worldwide, and even more grateful for the wonderful communtiy we've created. The best part is that it is only growing so call/ email us today to book your lesson suring with some of the best all around surfers and people around the world.
